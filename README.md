The Phantasos Template is a collection of code designed for use with Unity and the ink narrative scripting language (https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) to enable the creation of 'fake desktop' stories.
I share it here with the intention that other artists, programmers, and digital writers will be able to make use of it. If you do, please reach out - I would love to see what you make!

I strongly recommend installing the following in order to make the most of it, as many of its features were built in conjunction with them and will not work in isolation:

Unity Ink Integration - Inkle Studios - https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration/tree/master/Documentation

TimeKeeper - ProudCookie - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/timekeeper-in-game-time-simulation-and-event-scheduler-115554

Tween Animations Made Easy - GOGO GAGA - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/tween-animations-made-easy-visual-editor-for-leantween-228711

LeanTween - Dented Pixel - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595

Thanks are due to Daniel Cox and Trevor Mock for their tutorials on working with ink - if you are unsure how the ink integration in this template works, I recommend starting there.
