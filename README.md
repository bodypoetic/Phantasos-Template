The Phantasos Template is a collection of code designed for use with Unity and the ink narrative scripting language (https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) to enable the creation of 'fake desktop' stories.
I share it here with the intention that other artists, programmers, and digital writers will be able to make use of it. If you do, please reach out - I would love to see what you make!

I strongly recommend installing the following in order to make the most of it, as many of its features were built in conjunction with them and will not work in isolation:
